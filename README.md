## The Session Web Application
thesession.org is a database abundant with information on Irish traditional music, maintained by a wide community with a large following since the sites first release over twenty years ago, created by Jeremy Keith. Along with the growth of the database and community, thesession.org has seen a development in functionality and technology over the years. With the release of new features for the benefit of the user, the accompanying downsides can be expected which in this case can provide a negative user experience for the inexperienced typical site user. The site has a table-based layout that is complicated to navigate, unreadable and not user friendly. It does not comply to the current high standards expected of modern user interfaces in web development. The data on the website is text-based and content heavy. This application proposes a redesign of thesession.org, to improve navigation with a card-based design, implementing graphs and text visualisation in a user-friendly fashion, making the site progressive and up to scratch with newer interface designs. The site designed here has been shown to meet the usersâ€™ needs in an effective and delightful way.
